# 📅 React Date Counter App

A simple **React project** that allows you to move forward or backward in time by adjusting a step value. The app updates the date dynamically using JavaScript's `Date` object and React state management.

- 📅 Move forward or backward in days based on the current step

## 🖼️ Demo Examples

- If `count = 0` → **Today is \<date>**
