# 📅 React Date Counter App

A simple **React project** that allows you to move forward or backward in time by adjusting a step value. The app updates the date dynamically using JavaScript's `Date` object.

## 📌 Features

- 🔢 Increment or decrement the step value
- 📅 Move forward/backward in days based on the current step
- ⏳ Shows whether the date is **today, in the future, or in the past**
- ⚛️ Built with **React hooks (`useState`)**

## 🖼️ Demo

- If count = `0` → "Today is \<date>"
- If count = `5` → "5 days from today is \<date>"
- If count = `-3` → "3 days ago was \<date>"

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- React (useState hook)
- JavaScript (Date object)
- CSS for styling
